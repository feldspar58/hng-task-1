          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello! I'm Anyigor Joseph, a passionate frontend developer dedicated
            to crafting engaging and user-friendly web experiences. With a
            strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I specialize in
            building modern, responsive websites that look great and function
            seamlessly across all devices. My journey in web development is
            driven by a love for creativity and innovation, and I'm constantly
            exploring new technologies and techniques to enhance my skills. When
            I'm not coding, you can find me exploring design trends,
            contributing to open-source projects, or collaborating with fellow
            developers to bring ideas to life. Let's create something amazing
            together!

          <h2>Goals in This Program</h2>
          <p>
            My primary goal in the HNG Internship Program is to enhance my
            skills as a frontend developer by working on real-world projects and
            collaborating with experienced professionals. I aim to deepen my
            understanding of modern web technologies and best practices, while
            gaining hands-on experience in building responsive, user-centric
            applications. Additionally, I hope to expand my network within the
            tech community, learn from peers, and contribute meaningfully to
            projects. Ultimately, I aspire to emerge from this program as a more
            proficient developer, ready to take on new challenges and make a
            positive impact.

          <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Inconsistency in Practice:</strong> I sometimes lose
              momentum after periods of intense learning or project work. I’m
              improving by following structured coding schedules.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Difficulty Maintaining Focus:</strong> I get easily
              distracted when tasks feel unclear. I now break projects into
              smaller milestones with clear goals.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Advanced React Concepts:</strong> I’m still strengthening
              my understanding of custom hooks, performance optimization, and
              testing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Translating Designs to Code:</strong> Converting complex
              Figma designs to responsive layouts can be challenging. I’m
              practicing design-to-code conversions via Frontend Mentor.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Time Management:</strong> I sometimes underestimate how
              long tasks take. I now plan features as smaller, time-tracked
              goals.
