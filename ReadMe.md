# Profile Card

A simple static profile card web page that displays a user's avatar, name, bio, hobbies, dislikes, social links, and a live timestamp.

This project is a small front-end exercise built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript — no build tools or frameworks required.

## Files

- `index.html` — main page containing the profile card markup.
- `style.css` — styles for layout and responsive behavior.
- `app.js` — small script that sets the `#time` element. By default it currently writes the timestamp in milliseconds.
- `image/` — images used by the page (avatar and social icons).

## Preview

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the profile card. The page is responsive and will adapt for small screens.

## Timestamp formatting

By default `app.js` sets the `#time` element using `Date.now()` every second. 

## Running locally

1. Clone or copy the repository to your computer.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or right-click -> Open with...).

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
